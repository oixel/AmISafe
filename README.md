## Am I Safe?

This project helps visualize crimes across Gainesville through a map interface. Born out of a desire to find safe places in apartment hunting, this project helps students and other Gainesville residents understand their safety from a large database of crimes in Gainesville from 2010-present. Additionally, various filters are present to help narrow searches.

## How To Use
Our project can be accessed through the following link: www.amisaferightnow.com

_NOTE:_
Our initial code for testing functionality and development can be viewed in the OldFiles folder. This folder contains two subfolders: C++ and TestingSite. C++ contains our first attempt at creating data structures to handle the crime data. Meanwhile, the TestingSite folder contains our original code for parsing through the CSV data using JavaScript.
